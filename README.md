sequelize advanced models
 This is my first shot at node js while trying to create something fairly useful. It has a mysql db with model associations  using sequelize, file uploads and file delete 
 operations. I have background in laravel mvc model so I have structured my project in the same manner just for familiarity and modularization of the code.
